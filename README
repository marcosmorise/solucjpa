                          SoLUC JPA 1.0 - 2017-05-31

SoLUC JPA is a easy and lightweight persistence API written in Java that uses 
JPA Annotations to map objects with relational database tables and runs under 
JDBC.

Is developed using Reflection and Annotations to compose SQL commands, supports:
- Types - Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, String,
          Enum, Date, Blob, List and Entity annotated classes
- Identity generated values
- OneToMany composition with insert, update and delete on cascade
- ManyToOne agregation with agregated delete on cascade

Actually supports only Apache Derby, HSQLDB and MySQL Databases SQL dialect, but 
with community contribution this project will evolve and in the future will 
supports others SQL dialects.

The source-code are simple and commented, to implement others SQL dialects,
is only edit EntityManager.java file and modify createTable() and insert()
methods in the GeneratedValue annotation parts, other methods uses standard SQL 
dialect and no need to be edited.
