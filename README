                          SoLUC JPA 0.1 - 2017-05-22

SoLUC JPA is a easy and lightweight persistence API written in Java that uses 
JPA Annotations to map objects with relational database tables and runs under 
JDBC.

Is developed using Reflection and Annotations to compose SQL commands, supports:
- Types - Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, String,
          Enum, Date, Blob, List and Entity annotated Classes
- Identity generated values
- OneToMany composition with update and delete cascade
- ManyToOne agregation with delete cascade

Actually supports only Apache Derby Database SQL dialect, but with community
contribution this project will evolve and in the future will supports others SQL 
dialects.

The source-code are simple and commented, to implement others SQL dialects,
is only edit EntityManager.java file and modify createTable() and insert()
methods in the GeneratedValue annotation parts, other methods uses standard SQL 
dialect and no need to be edited.
